# Rev 3 Timer

This is another try at the "Nixie kitchen timer" originally conceived
in about 2000.  The first rev PCB (ExpressPCB mini board) I used for a
clock in my office; the 2nd rev for another clock with a separate
display board (elsewhere in this repo).

Now planning a new, integrated board with 4 IN-12A/B Nixies, ATMega
328 (168, 88) and the following UI features:

* 4 digit nixie display for primary timer (00:00 to 59:59)
* Multiple simultaneous timers with distinctive sounds
* Water/splash proof case with waterproof buttons

Optional features

* RTC for time display
* Auxiliary LCD display 

## Status

**2023-03-07**

Combo PCB layout done which can be sheared in the middle into control
and display sections.  RTC and aux LCD not included.  Note that we
have a working RTC on the scope clock board so that could be added.

Looking at 3D builds.  See 3D directory.
