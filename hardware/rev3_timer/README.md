# Rev 3 Timer

This is another try at the "Nixie kitchen timer" originally conceived in about 2000.
The first rev PCB (ExpressPCB mini board) I used for a clock in my office; the 2nd rev for another clock with a separate display board (elsewhere in this repo).

Now planning a new, integrated board with 4 IN-12A/B Nixies, ATMega 328 (168, 88) and the following 
UI features:

* 4 digit nixie display for primary timer (00:00 to 59:59)
* Multiple simultaneous timers with distinctive sounds
* Water/splash proof case with waterproof buttons

Optional features

* RTC for time display
* Auxiliary LCD display
